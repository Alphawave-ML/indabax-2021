    "We begin by providing an overview of RL. We then reveiw the OpenAI Gym interface and how to interact with it. We then go over environment wrappers and how they can be used to transform actions, observations, and rewards.

Finally, we apply a number of RL algorithms to the environment and visualise and compare the results."

    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) tries to solve a sequential decision-making problem, which is usually modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP). RL is concerned with how to choose actions from situations to maximise some notion of a numerical reward signal. The reward signal is a measure of how good the performed action or sequence of actions was, and it is used to guide software agents to learn optimal behaviour in a given\n",
    "situation. In RL, the idea of trial and error is central, since the agent is not instructed\n",
    "which actions to take and has no prior knowledge of the task at hand. The agent aims to\n",
    "discover the consequences of actions through experimentation. Sometimes an action may\n",
    "not only have an impact on the agentâ€™s current situation but may also have an impact on\n",
    "the subsequent situations that the agent encounters. Thus, the aspect of delayed reward\n",
    "signals is also an important concept, as the outcome of specific actions can be experienced\n",
    "at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment is the world that is assigned to the agent. It can be set in the\n",
    "physical world, or it can be in the form of a computer simulator. The latter is very popular\n",
    "to use for testing RL algorithms as simulations can be run at accelerated speeds.\n",
    "The environment characterises the task at hand by defining the actions available, the\n",
    "outcome of an action taken in a given situation, and the reward signal function. The\n",
    "current environmental situation is known as the state of the environment.\n",
    "The agent begins by receiving the initial state of the environment. The agent reacts to\n",
    "the state by sending an action to the environment; in return, the agent receives a new\n",
    "state and reward. The action of the agent is based on the observation received and chosen\n",
    "according to the agentâ€™s policy, where the policy determines the behaviour of the agent.\n",
    "The process of acting and receiving observations and rewards in return is recurrent. At\n",
    "each iteration of this process, the agent adjusts its policy to receive more rewards.\n",

    "\n",
    "How do we determine how good a given policy is? We first discuss how Monte Carlo (MC) methods can be used for prediction or policy evaluation.\n",
    "It has been shown by Sutton and Barto that if the agent follows a policy $\\pi$ and encounters a state $s$, the average return that follows the state $s$  will converge to the state's value $v_\\pi(s)$, as the number of times the state is visited approaches infinity. \n",
    "If an average is tracked for each action taken in the state $s$, then the state-action value $q_\\pi(s,a)$ can similarly be determined.\n",
    "These methods of estimating the value functions are called *Monte Carlo methods* because they entail averaging over many random sample episodes using the actual returns received.\n",
    "As MC methods use samples of entire episodes for policy evaluation, the estimate of the value function is unbiased.\n",
    "The drawback is that MC methods have to wait until the return $G_t$ is known.\n",
    "Therefore values of states can only be updated at the end of an episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time a state $s$ is encountered we refer to it as a *visit* to $s$.\n",
    "The first time the state $s$ is encountered, we refer to as the *first visit* to $s$.\n",
    "There are two main MC policy evaluation methods to estimate $v_\\pi$, namely the *first-visit* MC method and the *every-visit* MC method.\n",
    "It has been shown by Sutton and Barto that the first-visit MC method estimates $v_\\pi(s)$ as the mean return following the first visits to $s$.\n",
    "On the other hand, the every-visit MC method estimates $v_\\pi(s)$ as the mean return following all visits to $s$.\n",
    "According to Sutton and Barto, first-visit MC and every-visit MC converge to $v_\\pi(s)$ as the number of times $s$ is encountered, approaches infinity.\n",
    "The result is an unbiased estimate of the expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we're going to implement first-visit MC policy evaluation to evaluate a random policy in the gridworld environment. Our agent is going to complete full episodes in the environment and we are going to average the return it receives from each state over all episodes."

    "The following steps would be to use more sophisticated methods and solve problems with more complex observations than discrete coordinates. Solving this problem with a combination of features will result in a more general agent that can operate in more than one environment. Create a new observation wrapper that returns more general features from the environment. For instance, $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ to the goal. To get to the goal, try training an agent with Linear Function Approximation using these features. Start of with the simple environments, without the lava, and then add lava as an additional feature later on.\n",
